# Learning to Code Repository

Welcome to my learning to code repository! This repository serves as a centralized hub where I track all my resources and projects while I'm learning to code in different languages and topics. Each branch represents a different topic or language.

## About

Learning to code can be a daunting journey, but with dedication and consistent effort, I believe anyone can become proficient. This repository is not only a personal log of my progress but also a resource that I hope can inspire and assist others on their own coding journey.

## Structure

- Each branch in this repository represents a different topic or programming language.
- Inside each branch, you'll find a collection of resources, projects, and possibly some notes or documentation related to that specific topic or language.

## Getting Started

If you're new here, feel free to explore the branches to find the topic or language you're interested in. Inside each branch, you'll find a README file with more detailed information about the resources and projects available.

## Contributions

While this repository primarily serves as my personal learning tracker, I welcome contributions from others who are also on their coding journey. If you have suggestions for resources, improvements to existing projects, or new projects to add, feel free to submit a pull request!
